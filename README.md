# Hi there, I'm Lisa Ronquillo! ü¶Å

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I'm documenting my journey from academia to real estate to AI/ML and model development.

For over a decade, I've thrived on solving complex technical problems and leading teams to do the same. I've always been the person who loves digging into the "why" behind the "what." That curiosity has led me here‚Äîto not just solve the problem, but to build the solution.

I'm currently diving deep into the world of Python, exploring everything from web development to data analytics. My goal is to leverage my years of user-facing technical experience to build intuitive, efficient, and human-centered applications.

### What I'm Currently Working On

* Learning and building with **Python**, **Flask**, and **SQLAlchemy**.
* Sharpening my front-end skills with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
* Exploring the fundamentals of **data structures and algorithms**.
* My first major project, `Filipino Family Communication Adapter`, which is a `A web-based tool designed to help bridge communication gaps between generations in Filipino-American families, particularly for elderly relatives who may have hearing difficulties, mild dementia, autism spectrum traits, or cultural/linguistic differences. I'll be adding more to this as the project progresses`.

### My Tech Stack

* **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, Node.js
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite
* **Tools & Platforms:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Heroku

### A Little More About Me

When I'm not coding, you can find me `participating in progressive activism, reading a million books, taking courses, sculpting miniature clay cakes, dabbling in AI art, badly playing my guitar, and drinking copious amounts of black coffee`.  I believe the best solutions come from diverse perspectives, and I'm always open to a chat about technology, career transitions, or the best place to find a great taco!
